## üöÄ Tech Stack

Our application is built on a modern and efficient tech stack to provide a seamless user experience:

- **Frontend**: [Quasar Framework (Vue 3)](https://quasar.dev/)
- **State Management**: [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/)
- **Backend**: [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) (Authentication, Firestore Database, Cloud Functions, Cloud Storage)
- **Hosting**: [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting)
- **Offline Sync**: Firestore persistence + Quasar Progressive Web App (PWA)
- **Maps**: [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) + [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) (via Vue wrapper) or [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)
- **Weather API**: [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)
- **Routing (Internal)**: [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) (modular setup)
- **External Routing API**: [OpenRouteService](https://openrouteservice.org/)

## üß± Modules Overview

The application is structured into logical, self-contained modules for maintainability and scalability:

- `auth/`: Handles user authentication (login, registration, logout, profile).
- `dashboard/`: Displays an overview of all user's trips and provides options to create/join trips.
- `trip/`: Manages trip settings, member invitation, and trip deletion.
- `itinerary/`: Facilitates day-by-day schedule planning.
- `packing/`: Manages personal and shared gear checklists.
- `tasks/`: Enables task assignment and tracking.
- `budget/`: Manages shared expenses and cost splitting.
- `maps/`: Integrates map functionalities, weather forecasts, and route previews.
- `chat/` (optional): Provides a group chat feature per trip.
- `shared/`: Contains common UI components and composables used across modules.

## üìÇ Directory Structure

The project follows a modular directory structure for clear separation of concerns:
```

src/
modules/
auth/
pages/
components/
routes.js
stores/
services/
dashboard/
trip/
itinerary/
packing/
tasks/
budget/
maps/
chat/
shared/
boot/
firebase.js // Firebase initialization
apis.js // External API configurations (weather, maps, etc.)
router/
index.js // Main Vue Router setup
stores/
index.js // Pinia store setup
App.vue // Main application component
quasar.conf.js // Quasar configuration

```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Firebase Collections Structure

Our Firestore database is structured to efficiently store and retrieve trip-related data:

```

users/{uid}
trips/{tripId}

- name, location, members, startDate, endDate, inviteCode

trips/{tripId}/itinerary/{dayId}
trips/{tripId}/packingLists/{userId or 'shared'}
trips/{tripId}/tasks/{taskId}
trips/{tripId}/expenses/{expenseId}
trips/{tripId}/chat/{messageId} (optional)

```

## üó∫Ô∏è Free API Integration Plan

We leverage several free APIs to enhance the application's functionality:

| API                 | Use                                     | How Integrated                                     |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenWeatherMap      | Weather forecast by coordinates         | API key via Axios in `boot/apis.js`                |
| OpenStreetMap       | Display location maps                   | Utilizes Leaflet Vue wrapper                       |
| OpenRouteService    | Route planning (driving/hiking)         | API key (free with signup)                         |
| Recreation.gov (opt)| Search campsites (future consideration) | Potentially scraped or integrated unofficially     |

## üåü Quasar + Firebase Module Best Practices

We adhere to the following best practices for a clean and maintainable codebase:

* **Pinia Stores**: Utilize dedicated Pinia stores per module (e.g., `tripStore`, `taskStore`) for isolated state management.
* **Self-Contained Modules**: Each module is designed to be self-contained, including its routes, pages, stores, and services.
* **Shared State**: Common application-wide state (e.g., `currentTrip`) is managed in a top-level Pinia store for easy access.
* **Centralized Firebase Access**: Global Firebase initialization and access are handled within `boot/firebase.js`.
* **External API Setup**: External API configurations (Axios instances, API keys) are centralized in `boot/apis.js`.
