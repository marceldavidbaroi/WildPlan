# TimeInput Component

The `TimeInput` component provides an intuitive way for users to select a time using a set of dropdowns for hours, minutes, and AM/PM. It's designed to seamlessly integrate with `v-model` for easy two-way data binding in your Vue.js applications.

---

## What it is

`TimeInput` is a Vue 3 component that simplifies time selection. Instead of a single input field, it breaks down time entry into three distinct, user-friendly dropdowns:

- **Hour:** Allows selection from 1 to 12.
- **Minute:** Provides common minute intervals (00, 15, 30, 45).
- **AM/PM:** For specifying the meridiem.

This component is particularly useful for forms where precise time input is required without the need for a complex time picker UI.

## How it Works

The component uses Vue's Composition API to manage its internal state and synchronize with the `v-model` binding.

### Props

- `modelValue` (type: `string`): This prop facilitates `v-model` binding. It expects and emits a string in the format `"hh:mm AM/PM"` (e.g., `"01:30 PM"`).
- `label` (type: `string`, optional): An optional text label displayed before the time selection dropdowns.

### Internal State

The component maintains three internal `ref`s to manage the selected values of each dropdown:

- `selectedHour`: Stores the selected hour as a string.
- `selectedMinute`: Stores the selected minute as a string.
- `selectedMeridiem`: Stores the selected meridiem ('AM' or 'PM') as a `Meridiem` type.

### Data Flow and Synchronization

The component uses Vue's `watch` function to ensure seamless data flow between the `modelValue` prop and its internal state:

1.  **`modelValue` to Selects:** When the `modelValue` prop changes (e.g., updated by a parent component), a `watch`er immediately parses the incoming time string (expected format: `"hh:mm AM|PM"`). It then updates `selectedHour`, `selectedMinute`, and `selectedMeridiem` accordingly. If `modelValue` is empty or doesn't match the expected format, the internal selections are cleared. This ensures the dropdowns always reflect the `v-model`'s value.

2.  **Selects to `modelValue`:** Conversely, another `watch`er monitors any changes to `selectedHour`, `selectedMinute`, or `selectedMeridiem`. When all three internal selections have a value, the component constructs a formatted time string (e.g., `"03:00 PM"`) and emits it via `update:modelValue`. This keeps the `v-model` in the parent component synchronized with the user's selections. If any of the dropdowns are cleared, an empty string is emitted.

### Template Structure

The component's template uses a flexible layout (likely leveraging Quasar Framework's `row`, `items-center`, and `q-gutter-sm` classes) to arrange the label and the three `q-select` dropdowns horizontally. Each `q-select` is configured with `dense`, `outlined`, `emit-value`, and `map-options` for a clean and functional appearance.

## Usage Example

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <TimeInput v-model="appointmentTime" label="Appointment Time" />
    <p>Current Appointment Time: {{ appointmentTime }}</p>

    <q-btn @click="setMorningTime">Set 8:15 AM</q-btn>
    <q-btn @click="clearTime">Clear Time</q-btn>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from 'vue';
import TimeInput from './TimeInput.vue'; // Adjust the import path as necessary

const appointmentTime = ref('10:00 AM'); // Initial value for v-model

const setMorningTime = () => {
  appointmentTime.value = '08:15 AM';
};

const clearTime = () => {
  appointmentTime.value = ''; // Clears the selection
};
</script>
```
